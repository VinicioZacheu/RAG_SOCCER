# Team Balance Rules for Fot7

1. **Even skill distribution**  
   - Use aggregated skill scores (sum of IQ, speed, stamina, etc.) to keep both teams within 10% of each other.

2. **Position balance**  
   - Each team must include: 1 GK, at least 1 defender, 1 midfielder, 1 forward.

3. **Role specialization**  
   - Spread high-IQ players evenly to ensure decision-making balance.
   - Distribute fastest players evenly to maintain link play on the wings.

4. **Formation consistency**  
   - Stick to a chosen formation (e.g., 2-3-1) so that each team plays with a coherent tactical shape.

5. **Fitness & stamina**  
   - Evenly allocate high-stamina players to avoid one side tiring faster.

6. **Goal threat vs defense**  
   - Balance shooting and defending skills so neither team is overwhelmingly offensive or defensive.
